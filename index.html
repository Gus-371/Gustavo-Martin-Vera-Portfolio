                    <p>In a team of four, we were tasked with designing an energy-efficient UAV. To achieve this, we divided our group into two teams of two. The first team focused primarily on the structure of the UAV, designing and 3D printing the stand and base for our components. My team was responsible for programming the UAV's functions. As the group leader, I designated parts of the code to my team member.<br>We successfully made the UAV fully autonomous using an ultrasound sensor. To enhance energy efficiency, we used a voltage reader to take constant readings of the battery voltage, allowing for variable velocity based on the voltage readings, which helped increase flight time. For its main function, we programmed a wireless camera to provide a constant feed of the area being patrolled.<br>In addition to programming, I coordinated with the structural team leader to update schedules and meetings. I was also responsible for ordering parts and components for our project, filling out order forms for our school. I managed to procure industry-grade helium by contacting local suppliers and leveraging our school lab's connections, benefiting not only my group but also four other groups working on the same project.</p>

                    <p>As a group, we were tasked with building a bridge out of straws, requiring us to calculate the force needed for critical failure and identify the type of failure mode. I led the team responsible for the design and construction of prototypes. We researched typical bridge designs online to understand their structural principles. After narrowing down our possible designs, we tested the prototypes to determine the best-performing model, which became our final product.<br>Given I had the most experience in building straw bridges, I was responsible for constructing the final bridge, which was then tested in class. This process allowed us to gain firsthand experience in design for manufacturing and the design-build-test process.<br>Our calculations team used SolidWorks Finite Element Analysis to determine the failure force and location. Additionally, we employed hand calculations and distortion energy analysis to verify our results. In our final in-class test, the failure mode was buckling, and our predicted failure force was about 10% off from the actual result.</p>

This involved active participation in meetings and hands-on involvement during lab sessions for manufacturing. When the fin cage, sourced externally, didn't fit due to tolerance issues, we devised and implemented a jig to precisely remove material and achieve a proper fit within the rocket body. Additionally, we contributed to the fabricating of the rocket's Nose Cone using fiberglass and epoxy. This included preparing the mold with mold release, cutting fiberglass strands, and meticulously mixing resin and hardener to exact ratios. We applied layers of fiberglass and epoxy to our mold, ensuring proper bonding with rollers, and meticulously removed excess material post-hardening.</p>

                    <p>Here are examples of projects I completed in woodshop, where I utilized a variety of tools and machinery such as a bandsaw, jigsaw, sander, router, scroll saw, miter saw, chisels, etc. While following project guidelines, we were encouraged to exercise creative freedom in designing and crafting our pieces. I particularly found joy in creating artistic pieces using the router and aspire to continue pursuing woodworking as a hobby in the future.</p>

                    <p>As part of my mechanical engineering curriculum, CAD software was a foundational course that I undertook. Here are a selection of designs I created using SolidWorks, encompassing both class assignments and personal projects. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience in 3D printing.</p>
